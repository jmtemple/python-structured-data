    "# `.csv` data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `.csv` file? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSV stands for \"comma-separated values.\" CSV files are tabular data structures (i.e. a spreadsheet), stored in a plain-text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python includes a built-in `csv` module that allows us to read in data from a `.csv` file (or other type of delimited plain-text file), as well as write data to a `.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In `.csv` files, each line represents a row in the spreadsheet, and commas separate cells in each row (thus the file format name comma-separated values).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At first glance, `.csv` files look similar to proprietary spreadsheet program file formats, such as files saved in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. However, file formats like `.xls` or `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel) or `.numbers` (Apple Numbers) are NOT plain-text formats. Try to open these file types in a text editor and you'll quickly see the additional content and markup added by the spreadsheet program. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A few characteristics that distinguish `.csv` files (or other plain-text structured data formats) from proprietary spreadsheet file types:\n",
    "- Columns in a `.csv` file don't have a value type. Everything is a string.\n",
    "- Values in a `.csv` file don't have font or color formatting\n",
    "- `.csv` files only contain single worksheets\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't store formatting information like cell width/height\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't recognize merged cells or other kinds of special formatting (frozen or hidden rows/columns, embedded images, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Given these limitations, especially compared to the way we often interact with spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, what's the advantage of working with `.csv` files?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. One key advantage of `.csv` files is their simplicity. You can load or open a `.csv` file in a text editor and be able to quickly see the values in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. When working with data in a programming environment, `.csv` files as a plain-text format simplify the process of loading structured data."

    "# JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JSON and why are we learning about it\n",
    "\n",
    "64. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is as popular way to format data as a single (purportedly human-readable) string. \n",
    "\n",
    "65. JavaScript programs use JSON data structures, but we can frequently encounter JSON data outside of a JavaScript environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. Websites that make machine-readable data available via an application programming interface (API- more on these in an upcoming lab) often provide that data in a JSON format. Examples include Twitter, Wikipedia, Data.gov, etc. Most live data connections available via an API are provided in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. JSON structure can vary WIDELY depending on the specific data provider, but this lab will cover some basic elements of working with JSON in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. The easiest way to think of JSON data as a plain-text data format made up of something like key-value pairs, like we've encountered previously in working with dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. Example JSON string: `stringOfJsonData = '{\"name\": Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "70. From looking at the example string, we can see field names or keys (`name`, `isCat`, `miceCaught`, `felineIQ`) and values for those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. To use more precise terminology, JSON data has the following attributes:\n",
    "- uses name/value pairs\n",
    "- separates data using commas\n",
    "- holds objects using curly braces `{}`\n",
    "- holds arrays using square brackets `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "72. In our example `stringOfJsonData`, we have an object contained in curly braces. \n",
    "\n",
    "73. An object can include multiple name/value pairs. Multiple objects together can form an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. Values stored in JSON format must be one of the following data types:\n",
    "- string\n",
    "- number\n",
    "- object (JSON object)\n",
    "- array\n",
    "- boolean\n",
    "- null\n",
    "\n",
    "75. How is data stored in a JSON format different than a CSV? \n",
    "\n",
    "76. A `.csv` file uses characters as delimiters and has more of a tabular (table-like) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. JSON data uses characters as part of the syntax, but not in the same way as delimited data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "78. Additionally, the data stored in a JSON format has values that are attached to names (or keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "79. JSON can also have a hierarchical or nested structure, in that objects can be stored or nested inside other objects as part of the same array.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. For example, take a look at sapmle JSON data from Twitter's API:\n",

    "136. Let's say we want to work with the U.S. Census Bureau's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "137. First step is to navigate to the Census Bureau's [\"About\"](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html) page for developers and click the \"Request a Key\" icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "138. Once you've completed the \"Request a Key\" form, you should receive an API key via email. This will look like a long string of letters and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "139. Next step is to identify which Census Bureau dataset you want to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "140. Lots of options, ranging from the facets of data from the American Community Survey to data from the Decennial Census.\n",
    "\n",
    "141. Explore the list of options ([\"Available APIs\"](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)) and decide on a specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "142. For the purposes of this example, I'm going to work with [five-year data from the American Community survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html)to find a recent population count for all US states.\n",
    "\n",
    "143. First thing I want to do is explore the documentation available for this dataset so I know what might (or should) return from the API call.\n",
    "- [Link to documentation for 2019 subset of this dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html)\n",

    "144. As you can see from the documentation, there are MANY variables and data points contained in this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "145. For this example, I'm going to stick to the original question of wanting a recent population count for all states.\n",

    "147. And from looking at the full list of variables, I know my variable name for \"Total Population is `B01003_001E`.\n",
    "\n",
    "148. So my API call for the \"Total Population\" variable will look like `https://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs5?key=[YOUR_API_KEY]&get=B01003_001E`.\n",
    "\n",
    "149. This API call will return total population for all geographies in the ACS dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "150. I can modify the API call to only return \"Total Population\" by state.\n",
    "\n",
    "151. The modified API call will look like `https://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs5?key=[YOUR_API_KEY]&get=B01003_001E&for=state:*`.\n",
