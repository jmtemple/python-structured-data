    "\n",
    "This lab covers various methods for reading structured data into Python, focusing on `csv` and `json`. It covers other types of delimiters and escape characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the structure and components of a `.csv` file\n",
    "- Read a `.csv` file into Python using the `csv` module and a `for` loop\n",
    "- Understand how to approach other types of delimited files\n",
    "- Understand how to work with escape characters when loading structured data\n",
    "- Read JSON data into Python using the `json` module\n",

    "# `.csv` data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `.csv` file? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSV stands for \"comma-separated values.\" CSV files are tabular data structures (i.e. a spreadsheet), stored in a plain-text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python includes a built-in `csv` module that allows us to read in data from a `.csv` file (or other type of delimited plain-text file), as well as write data to a `.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In `.csv` files, each line represents a row in the spreadsheet, and commas separate cells in each row (thus the file format name comma-separated values).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At first glance, `.csv` files look similar to proprietary spreadsheet program file formats, such as files saved in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. However, file formats like `.xls` or `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel) or `.numbers` (Apple Numbers) are NOT plain-text formats. Try to open these file types in a text editor and you'll quickly see the additional content and markup added by the spreadsheet program. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A few characteristics that distinguish `.csv` files (or other plain-text structured data formats) from proprietary spreadsheet file types:\n",
    "- Columns in a `.csv` file don't have a value type. Everything is a string.\n",
    "- Values in a `.csv` file don't have font or color formatting\n",
    "- `.csv` files only contain single worksheets\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't store formatting information like cell width/height\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't recognize merged cells or other kinds of special formatting (frozen or hidden rows/columns, embedded images, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Given these limitations, especially compared to the way we often interact with spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, what's the advantage of working with `.csv` files?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. One key advantage of `.csv` files is their simplicity. You can load or open a `.csv` file in a text editor and be able to quickly see the values in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. When working with data in a programming environment, `.csv` files as a plain-text format simplify the process of loading structured data."

    "# JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JSON and why are we learning about it\n",
    "\n",
    "64. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is as popular way to format data as a single (purportedly human-readable) string. \n",
    "\n",
    "65. JavaScript programs use JSON data structures, but we can frequently encounter JSON data outside of a JavaScript environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. Websites that make machine-readable data available via an application programming interface (API- more on these in an upcoming lab) often provide that data in a JSON format. Examples include Twitter, Wikipedia, Data.gov, etc. Most live data connections available via an API are provided in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. JSON structure can vary WIDELY depending on the specific data provider, but this lab will cover some basic elements of working with JSON in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. The easiest way to think of JSON data as a plain-text data format made up of something like key-value pairs, like we've encountered previously in working with dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. Example JSON string: `stringOfJsonData = '{\"name\": Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "70. From looking at the example string, we can see field names or keys (`name`, `isCat`, `miceCaught`, `felineIQ`) and values for those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. To use more precise terminology, JSON data has the following attributes:\n",
    "- uses name/value pairs\n",
    "- separates data using commas\n",
    "- holds objects using curly braces `{}`\n",
    "- holds arrays using square brackets `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "72. In our example `stringOfJsonData`, we have an object contained in curly braces. \n",
    "\n",
    "73. An object can include multiple name/value pairs. Multiple objects together can form an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. Values stored in JSON format must be one of the following data types:\n",
    "- string\n",
    "- number\n",
    "- object (JSON object)\n",
    "- array\n",
    "- boolean\n",
    "- null\n",
    "\n",
    "75. How is data stored in a JSON format different than a CSV? \n",
    "\n",
    "76. A `.csv` file uses characters as delimiters and has more of a tabular (table-like) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. JSON data uses characters as part of the syntax, but not in the same way as delimited data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "78. Additionally, the data stored in a JSON format has values that are attached to names (or keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "79. JSON can also have a hierarchical or nested structure, in that objects can be stored or nested inside other objects as part of the same array.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. For example, take a look at sapmle JSON data from Twitter's API:\n",
    "```JSON\n",
